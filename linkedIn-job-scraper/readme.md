---

## 🧠 Strategy (as Lead Data Engineer)

### 📌 Phase 1 – Planning & Setup

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| ✅ Define your exact **search query** (e.g., “Data Engineer” + Vancouver) | Ensures relevance |
| ✅ Use **GitHub Codespaces or local virtualenv** | Keeps your environment isolated |
| ✅ Set up `.env` and `credentials.json` | Connect Sheets + Telegram securely |

---

### 🔎 Phase 2 – Web Scraping (LinkedIn Jobs)

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| 🔐 Log in if needed | Use `Selenium`, `Playwright`, or authenticated `requests` |
| 📄 Extract fields: | `title`, `company`, `location`, `posted time`, `job URL` |
| 📌 Filter by: | Location = Vancouver, Keyword = "Data Engineer" |
| 🧪 Test with 5–10 listings | Ensure clean data extraction |

---

### 🧱 Phase 3 – Data Structuring

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `Job Title` | Data Engineer II |
| `Company` | Amazon |
| `Location` | Vancouver, BC |
| `Posted` | 3 days ago |
| `Link` | https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/... |

---

### 📤 Phase 4 – Google Sheets Integration

| Task | Tool |
|------|------|
| Connect with `gspread` | Append jobs to a Sheet |
| Add headers: `Title`, `Company`, `Location`, `Posted`, `Link` | Keeps format consistent |

---

### 📬 Phase 5 – Telegram Notifications

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| ✅ Send a summary (e.g., “12 new jobs found”) | Use Telegram Bot API |
| ✅ Optional: include top 1–3 job links | Short digest in message |

---

### ⏰ Phase 6 – Automation (Optional)

| Option | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Daily scrape | GitHub Actions (`scraper.yml`) |
| Manual run | `python run.py` |

---

### 📈 Bonus Ideas (Future Enhancements)

- Exclude internships or junior roles
- Add job category tags (Cloud, BI, ML, etc.)
- Filter by company or date
- Visualize with Looker Studio or Notion
