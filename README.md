# Bita Ashoori — Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of practical data engineering projects focused on real-world pipelines, automation, and analytics.

The projects here reflect how I approach data work in production: ingesting data from unreliable sources, transforming it into usable structures, orchestrating workflows, and exposing insights through analytics or downstream systems.

**Core skills demonstrated**
- Data ingestion from APIs, files, and web sources  
- ETL / ELT pipeline design and orchestration  
- SQL modeling and analytics-ready schemas  
- Cloud and container-based workflows  
- Python-based data processing and automation

---

### Healthcare FHIR Data Pipeline  
**Tech:** Python, Pandas, SQLite, Streamlit  
Processes FHIR-formatted healthcare JSON into structured analytical tables and visual dashboards. Demonstrates data normalization, healthcare data handling, and reporting.

---

### Real-Time Marketing Data Pipeline  
**Tech:** Airflow, Docker, SQL  
Simulates near real-time marketing events and processes them through scheduled pipelines. Emphasizes time-based transformations, aggregation logic, and analytics readiness.

---

### Customer Insights Pipeline  
**Tech:** Python, PostgreSQL, Airflow  
Combines multiple customer datasets into unified reporting tables. Focuses on joins, transformations, and analytics-friendly schema design.

---

### PySpark Sales Pipeline  
**Tech:** PySpark, Delta Lake  
Distributed data processing pipeline that transforms raw sales data into cleaned, analytics-ready layers. Demonstrates scalable data engineering patterns.

---

### AWS Lambda LinkedIn Job Scraper  
**Tech:** AWS Lambda, Python, S3  
Serverless scraper that extracts job listings and stores structured outputs in cloud storage. Highlights automation and event-driven architecture.

---

### Patient Engagement Analytics  
**Tech:** SQL, Pandas  
ETL workflow analyzing patient engagement behavior across datasets. Designed for trend analysis and reporting use cases.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio is intentionally practical.  
Each project exists to simulate or solve real data engineering problems rather than showcase theory or toy examples.

I actively iterate on these projects as I learn new tools and patterns in cloud data engineering.
