# 🧠 Data Engineering Portfolio – Bita Ashoori

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my hands-on experience in building **scalable, cloud-native data pipelines** across various real-world scenarios. The projects highlight my expertise in:

- ⚙️ ETL/ELT automation with **Apache Airflow**
- 🧊 Cloud data warehousing using **AWS S3**, **Redshift**, and **Lambda**
- 🔁 Stream and batch processing using **PySpark**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite**
- 📈 Dashboarding and insights with **Streamlit** and **Power BI**
- 🔍 Web scraping and automation using **BeautifulSoup**, **APIs**, and **serverless architecture**
