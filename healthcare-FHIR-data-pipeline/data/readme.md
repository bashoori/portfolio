## ğŸ“š About the Dataset

This project uses synthetic patient data generated with [Syntheaâ„¢](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea), an open-source synthetic health data generator.

Although the data is based on U.S. healthcare demographics and locations, it is used in this project to **simulate a real-world healthcare pipeline** for educational and prototyping purposes.

ğŸ§ª The data follows the **FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** standard and includes structured records for:

- `Patient`
- `Encounter`
- `Observation`
- `Condition`

> ğŸ“Œ Note: While the project context assumes a Canadian setting (British Columbia), the source data remains U.S.-based.
